Master's physics student at the [University of Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/physics) doing a project on wide-field VLBI observations with the [EVN](https://www.evlbi.org/) and the expansion of observational fields of view
of the antennae in the network. Wide-field observations with VLBI generally are for searching the skies for AGN and my project is aimed at increasing the area a single
EVN pointing can cover, which would reduce the amount of time required to build such surveys. Larger FOVs would also make searches for gravitationally lensed objects 
more time-efficient and woud enable ISM studies of large galaxies such as M31 to cover wider areas of said galaxies with single pointings.

At this point I'm interested in VLBI surveys searching for AGN and improving detection rates and capabilities. I wouldn't mind dabbling with something like the [VLA](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/) or
[eMERLIN](https://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/) (maybe even [MeerKAT](https://www.sarao.ac.za/gallery/meerkat/) since it's local to me) to learn how to calibrate shorter-baseline interferometer data.

The main piece of software I'm using is [CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/), but I had to use [AIPS](http://www.aips.nrao.edu/) as well for the a-priori calibration due to some observational problems. To automate some things I'm
using Python and the casavlbitools library with JSON input files.

I decided to start uploading my code as a way of backing it up for future reference; note that I'm by no means an efficient coder. My Python code might make some people
cringe to death
